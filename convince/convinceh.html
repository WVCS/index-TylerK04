   <h2 class="rb"> Reasons to Believe the Earth is Shaped Like a Fork </h2>
 <ol class="reasons">
  <li>  100% real pictures, as you can see, the picture in the logo above is totally real. </li>
  <li>  The Internet said so, as you all know, the Internet is the best place to learn things, and it is always factual, like who has every found something incorrect on the Internet? </li>
  <li>  Forks are awesome, they help you eat food, what more is there to say? </li>
  <li>  I said so</li>
  </ol>

   <h2 class="ca"> What should you do now? </h2>
   <p class="what"> Now that you know the truth about the universe, you should go and tell everyone you know how enlighented you've become. I'm sure they'll be jealous about how you know the meaning of the universe, and they don't. </p>
